            To draw shapes, click on the palette on the right hand side, then click and drag 
            on the diagram editor on the left handside to draw shapes.
            Note: if you click on multiple shapes on the palette before drawing, when you click and drag on the diagram
            editor, it will draw all those shapes at once. <br>
            <br>
            All shapes that are drawn will have a text element floating near them.
            To draw connectors from one shape to another, left click the text element 'link' on whichever shape
            you wish, then double click on the SHAPE that you wish to connect to. <br>
            <br>
            Note: Once you clicked on the text element 'link' of a particular shape, you no longer need to click on
            the text to connect the selected shape with other shapes. After clicking it once, you can double click on
            any other shape to link them together. <br>
            <br>
            If you now wish to connect a different shape with other shapes, you can double click on the text element
            'link' of the previously selected shape (this will disable it from generating connections with other shapes).
            After doing so, click on the text element 'link' of the new shape that you want to connect with other shapes
             and double click the shapes that you want to pair up links with in order to generate the new connections.
