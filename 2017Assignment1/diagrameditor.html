    <h1> Your diagram editor app goes here! </h1>    
    <p> Select a shape on the right hand side. Then click and drag on the left hand side to draw the
        selected shape. <br>
        <br>

        To link shapes together, click on the text 'link' of one shape and double click on another target
        shape to link 2 shapes together.<br>
        Note: once you've clicked the text 'link' of one shape, you can double click any number of other target
        shapes to connect that one shape with all of those targeted shapes.<br>
        <br>
        If you do not wish to connect that shape with other shapes anymore, double click on the text 'link' 
        to disable the generation of links of that shape with other shapes.
